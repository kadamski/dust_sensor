## Howto: dust sensor HW

### Overview

This project is an open hardware project aimed for intermediate software developers and electronics engineers (as well as others, provided they've got someone of the electronics background at hand).
The idea behind the project is to provide _**cheap and easy to build**_ **dust sensor** that will measure **PM2.5, PM10**, Temperature and Humidity, display those on the LCD and be able to send the values onto dedicated server (e.g. http get).
